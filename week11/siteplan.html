    <h1>Thomas Gardner - WDD131 Final Project Siteplan</h1>

    <h3>Requirements</h3>
    <pre>
- The personal site must consist of a home page and at least one child page.
- The website must be hosted on the web.
- Each page of your Web site must satisfy the following requirements:
    Significant textual content, appropriate for your audience, so that they can understand the meaning and message of this site.
    At least one image that relates to the content of the page.
    Working links to your child page(s).
    Be laid out and styled according to your site plan wireframes.
    Be responsive
    Be visually appealing and easily readable.
    Be valid HTML and CSS
    Score at least 96 on Lighthouse on Performance and Accessibility.
- The site should have dynamic elements provided by Javascript, your code should show elements of the following:
    It should show some level of organization: at a minimum it should have more than one function.
    It should include DOM interaction: select an element, modify it, and listen for and react to events
    It should show examples of conditional branching
    Each of the following should be used: Objects, ES Modules, Arrays and array method usage (forEach, map, reduce, filter, etc)
    </pre>

    <h3>Current Thoughts</h3>
    <pre>
Final Requirements
1. Have 1 or more fonts, a color scheme. Ensure things look nice overall and match the wireframes. Test with lighthouse
2. Have at least 1 image per page and ensure each page has significant or meaningful text that is appropriate for your audience
3. For JS ensure I have : Element interaction (listen for events and modify element(s)), conditional branching, and should make use of objects, modules (dynamic content), arrays, and array methods

JavaScript Ideas
1. Picture display (lets users click through images - arrays, events, element modification, branching)
2. Comments, articles, Etc. (dynamic content / objects)
3. Theme selector
4. Menu bar (collapsable and dynamic with the screen)

Website Ideas
0. Have a light and dark theme
1. A review page (subpage) that lists user experiences (text, image, name, rating) within a dynamic carasell , (comments - you can pots temporary comments to leave a 'review')
2. A Main Page. (Update the website I made previously) OR a bank page. The idea is targeting new clients by giving them a dynamic budgeter. Will let you put in positive and negative items and it will do the math for you. You can add or remove items in the list (Potential for all JS elements). Text will be about the benefit of this bank in saving you money through these budgeting and smart algorithms

    </pre>

    <br /><br />
    <h2>Purpose and Audience</h2>
    <p>
      This will be a banking application's home screen, it will be trying to
      persuade viewers to join this bank. The audience will be middle aged and
      younger adults who are looking for a bank to manage their finances
      through.
    </p>

    <br /><br />
    <h2>Description of the Dynamic Elements</h2>
    <p>
      The main page and subpage will both have a light/dark theme. The main page
      will have a dynamic budgeting tool where the user can add or remove items
      within their budget. This tool will let you add 'positive' items like
      paychecks and negative items like 'groceries'. You can add or remove as
      many as you'd like dynamically. When you're ready, it will tally
      everything together and output a message. The message will be random tips
      or encouragement based on if you lost money or not. This tool will have
      dynamic content that auto-populates initially with some sample items. The
      subpage will be a combined 'about us' and 'review page'. There will be a
      carousell that will feature dynamically populated 'featured' reviews that
      include a name, picture, and rating / comment. It will slide every few
      seconds or when the user clicks the next arrows. There will also be a
      dynamically populated review / comment section with some pre-made comments
      / reviews. The user can comment with their personal review as well.
    </p>

    <h2>Logo</h2>
    <p>Choose a logo image for your personal site.</p>

      src="./images/transparent_saveharbor_logo_1.png"
      alt="The Saveharbor Logo one"
    />

      src="./images/transparent_saveharbor_logo_2.png"

    <img
      src="./images/transparent_saveharbor_logo_4.png"
      alt="The Saveharbor Logo four"
    />

    <br /><br />
    <h2>Colors and Fonts</h2>
    <p>
      Choose a color scheme and one or more fonts that you think will work well
      and enter the information into the plan's HTML and CSS.
    </p>

    <div class="light-color-block">
      <p>
        I will use the color white and a darkish blue color '#2a4682' for my
        light theme. White will be the primary color used and the blue the
        secondary. For menus or element blocks, I will use the blue, but the
        body as a whole will be white. When using white as the background, I
        will use the same
        <span class="mid-light-color-block">'blue #2a4682'</span> color
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="dark-color-block">
      <p>
        For my dark theme, I will use a dark gray color '#222' as my primary
        color where the color white is used for the text. I will have a
        secondary color,
        <span class="mid-dark-color-block"> a light purple '#9184d2'</span> that
        uses the same dark gray color '#222' for the text. The dark gray and
        white will be used on the body as a whole while the purple and gray are
        used on menus and element blocks
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>The following are the 2 fonts I will be using.</p>
    <p style="font-family: lato">Lato Font - For my headers</p>
    <p style="font-family: sans-serif">
      Sans Serif Font - For my paragraphs / base text
    </p>
    <p>
      I use a large font-size to help improve readability and give a 'calm' and
      'relaxing' feel.
    </p>
