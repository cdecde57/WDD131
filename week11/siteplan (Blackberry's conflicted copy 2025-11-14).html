    <h1>Thomas Gardner - WDD131 Final Project Siteplan</h1>

    <h3>Requirements</h3>
    <pre>
- The personal site must consist of a home page and at least one child page.
- The website must be hosted on the web.
- Each page of your Web site must satisfy the following requirements:
    Significant textual content, appropriate for your audience, so that they can understand the meaning and message of this site.
    At least one image that relates to the content of the page.
    Working links to your child page(s).
    Be laid out and styled according to your site plan wireframes.
    Be responsive
    Be visually appealing and easily readable.
    Be valid HTML and CSS
    Score at least 96 on Lighthouse on Performance and Accessibility.
- The site should have dynamic elements provided by Javascript, your code should show elements of the following:
    It should show some level of organization: at a minimum it should have more than one function.
    It should include DOM interaction: select an element, modify it, and listen for and react to events
    It should show examples of conditional branching
    Each of the following should be used: Objects, ES Modules, Arrays and array method usage (forEach, map, reduce, filter, etc)
    </pre>

    <h3>Current Thoughts</h3>
    <pre>
Final Requirements
1. Have 1 or more fonts, a color scheme. Ensure things look nice overall and match the wireframes. Test with lighthouse
2. Have at least 1 image per page and ensure each page has significant or meaningful text that is appropriate for your audience
3. For JS ensure I have : Element interaction (listen for events and modify element(s)), conditional branching, and should make use of objects, modules (dynamic content), arrays, and array methods

JavaScript Ideas
1. Picture display (lets users click through images - arrays, events, element modification, branching)
2. Comments, articles, Etc. (dynamic content / objects)
3. Theme selector
4. Menu bar (collapsable and dynamic with the screen)

Website Ideas
1. Basic Financing Application
    The Main Page - Goal is to get people to join as a customer. Provide a mini-budgeter (add / subtract across a month or year), populates different finance strategies using a search feature similar to week 10
    A review page (learn more and about us) (subpage) that lists user experiences (text, image, name, rating) within a dynamic carasell, (messager - shows messages you sent on the page to support)
