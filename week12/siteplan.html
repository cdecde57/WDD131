      people and in assisting with generating text for page content.
    </p>

    Each of the following should be used: Objects, ES Modules, Arrays and array method usage (forEach, map, reduce, filter, etc)
    </pre>

    <!--
    <h3>Current Thoughts</h3>
    <pre>
Final Requirements
1. Have 1 or more fonts, a color scheme. Ensure things look nice overall and match the wireframes. Test with lighthouse
2. Have at least 1 image per page and ensure each page has significant or meaningful text that is appropriate for your audience
3. For JS ensure I have : Element interaction (listen for events and modify element(s)), conditional branching, and should make use of objects, modules (dynamic content), arrays, and array methods

JavaScript Ideas
1. Picture display (lets users click through images - arrays, events, element modification, branching)
2. Comments, articles, Etc. (dynamic content / objects)
3. Theme selector
4. Menu bar (collapsable and dynamic with the screen)

Website Ideas
0. Have a light and dark theme
1. A review page (subpage) that lists user experiences (text, image, name, rating) within a dynamic carasell , (comments - you can pots temporary comments to leave a 'review')
2. A Main Page. (Update the website I made previously) OR a bank page. The idea is targeting new clients by giving them a dynamic budgeter. Will let you put in positive and negative items and it will do the math for you. You can add or remove items in the list (Potential for all JS elements). Text will be about the benefit of this bank in saving you money through these budgeting and smart algorithms
  </pre>

    <br /><br />
    <h2>Purpose and Audience</h2>
    <p>
      This will be a banking application's home screen, it will be trying to
      persuade viewers to join this bank. The audience will be middle aged and
      younger adults who are looking for a bank to manage their finances
      through.
    </p>

    <br /><br />
    <h2>Description of the Dynamic Elements</h2>
    <p>
      The main page and subpage will both have a light/dark theme and a
      collapsable menu bar for mobile screens. The main page will have a dynamic
      budgeting tool where the user can add or remove items within their budget.
      This tool will let you add 'positive' items like paychecks and negative
      items like 'groceries'. You can add or remove as many as you'd like
      dynamically. When you're ready, it will tally everything together and
      output a message. The message will be random tips or encouragement based
      on if you lost money or not. This tool will have dynamic content that
      auto-populates initially with some sample items. The subpage will be a
      combined 'about us' and 'review page'. There will be a carousell that will
      feature dynamically populated 'featured' reviews that include a name,
      picture, and rating / comment. It will slide every few seconds or when the
      user clicks the next arrows. There will also be a dynamically populated
      review / comment section with some pre-made comments / reviews. The user
      can comment with their personal review as well.
    </p>

    <h2>Colors and Fonts</h2>
    <p>
      Choose a color scheme and one or more fonts that you think will work well
      and enter the information into the plan's HTML and CSS.
    </p>

    <div class="light-color-block">
      <p>
        I will use the color white and a darkish blue color '#2a4682' for my
        light theme. White will be the primary color used and the blue the
        secondary. For menus or element blocks, I will use the blue, but the
        body as a whole will be white. When using white as the background, I
        will use the same
        <span class="mid-light-color-block">'blue #2a4682'</span> color
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="dark-color-block">
      <p>
        For my dark theme, I will use a dark gray color '#222' as my primary
        color where the color white is used for the text. I will have a
        secondary color,
        <span class="mid-dark-color-block"> a light purple '#9184d2'</span> that
        uses the same dark gray color '#222' for the text. The dark gray and
        white will be used on the body as a whole while the purple and gray are
        used on menus and element blocks
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>The following are the 2 fonts I will be using.</p>
    <p style="font-family: lato">Lato Font - For my headers</p>
    <p style="font-family: sans-serif">
      Sans Serif Font - For my paragraphs / base text
    </p>
    <p>
      I use a large font-size to help improve readability and give a 'calm' and
      'relaxing' feel.
    </p>

- Why us and join now

    Our mission comes from a very real place. Before starting this company, our CEO spent years feeling overwhelmed by budgeting apps that were too complicated and banks that offered accounts but no real guidance. 
    Even with steady income, he constantly found himself guessing how much to save, guessing how long it would take to pay off old debt, guessing if he was even on the right track. He knew there had to be a better way. 
    That experience is what inspired this platform: a simple, modern banking experience built to help you feel confident, informed, and in control of your financial future.

    That’s why we focus on clarity, real support, and tools that make a difference. Our accounts are designed to grow your savings faster, our budgeting tools help you understand your habits instantly, and our clear projections show you where you’re headed not just where you’ve been. 
    We’d love for you to be part of this. Explore what we offer or join us today and start building the financial future you’ve always wanted!

- About Us / Reviews introduction
    We built this platform with one goal in mind: to make managing money feel understandable, achievable, and empowering. Too many individuals and families are left to figure things out alone, with banks offering accounts but not real support. 
    We wanted to change that. Everything we provide and create is designed to help you build confidence, get organized, and make progress without the frustration or confusion that usually comes with managing finances.

    And the best part? Our customers feel the difference. People tell us they finally understand their spending habits, feel motivated to save, and actually enjoy watching their progress grow. 
    Many share stories of paying down debt faster than expected, hitting savings goals for the first time, or simply feeling less stressed about money. 
    Their experiences are what drive us they remind us why we built this and why we keep improving every tool, feature, and experience we offer.

    If you want an inside look at what real users are saying, explore the reviews below and see how others are using our platform to transform their financial journey. 
    We hope their stories inspire you, guide you, and show you what’s possible when you have the right support behind you!

- Text to invite the user to give a review or join us
    If you’re already part of our community, we’d love to hear your story. Your experience whether it’s a small win, a big milestone, or something you’ve learned along the way helps others see what’s possible. 
    Every review gives someone else the encouragement they need to start improving their financial life, and your voice could be exactly what inspires them to begin.

    Sharing your thoughts also helps us grow. We listen closely to what our members say so we can keep improving our tools, add new features, and build a platform that truly supports your goals. 
    If you have a moment, we’d be grateful for your feedback. Your journey matters, and we’re honored to be part of it.

    “This is the first time I’ve actually felt in control of my money. The budgeting tool makes it so easy to understand where I’m at and what I need to do next.”

    “I’ve tried other banks, but none made saving feel this simple. The long-term, high-interest account helped me build momentum faster than I expected.”

    “Customer support has been incredible quick answers and real guidance instead of canned replies. It’s clear they actually want you to succeed.”

    “I used to get overwhelmed trying to budget, but their tools break everything down in a way that finally makes sense. It’s changed how I manage my paycheck!”

    “The projections feature helped me see exactly how long it would take to pay off my debt, and for the first time, it felt achievable. That clarity made all the difference.”

    “I joined just hoping to save a little more, but I ended up feeling way more confident about my entire financial plan. Their focus on helping users grow really shows.”
